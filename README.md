<h1> This is Spring boot project</h1>

<h3> I have done it with docker and docker compose so you can just run "docker compose up" command<h3>

<h4> After running command you can check these URL to get time <u>http://localhost:8013/time</u> or you can run just spring boot, but in that case you can check this url <u>http://localhost:8080/time</u></h4>

<h4>To upload image you have <u>http://localhost:8013/upload</u> url  or <u>http://localhost:8080/upload</u>,  but you have to use postman to test it</h4>

<h4>I also added Adminer to see Database tables if you want. It is  <u>http://localhost:8011/</u> in the docker images. you can get credential from .env file</h4>
<h4> For Swagger you can check <u>http://localhost:8013/swagger-ui/index.html</u> or <u>http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/index.html</u> </h4>

<h4> I also wrote some test if you want to check</h4>
