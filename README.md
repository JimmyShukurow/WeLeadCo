<h1> This is Spring boot project</h1>

<h3> I have done it with docker and docker compose so you can just run "docker compose up" command<h3>

<h5> After running command you can check these URL to get time http://localhost:8013/time or you can run just spring boot, but in that case you can check this url http://localhost:8080/time<h5>

<h5>To upload image you have http://localhost:8013/upload url  or http://localhost:8080/upload,  but you have to use postman to test it<h5>

<h5>I also added Adminer to see Database tables if you want. It is  http://localhost:8011/ in the docker images. you can get credential from .env file<h5>

<h5> I also wrote some test if you want to check</h5>
